# 🖼️ Computer Vision (CNN) with TensorFlow & Keras  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository documents my learning journey from the **Computer Vision** course, where I explored the fundamentals of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their applications in deep learning. Using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, I built and trained CNN models for image classification and feature extraction.  

## 🚀 Key Learnings  
- **The Convolutional Classifier** – Built my first image classification model using Keras.  
- **Convolution and ReLU** – Understood how convolutional layers detect features in images.  
- **Maximum Pooling** – Implemented pooling layers to enhance feature extraction.  
- **The Sliding Window** – Explored stride and padding in convolutional networks.  
- **Custom Convnets** – Designed and fine-tuned my own convolutional neural networks.  
- **Data Augmentation** – Applied data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **TensorFlow & Keras**  
- **Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)**  
- **OpenCV for image processing**  
- **Jupyter Notebook for experimentation**
